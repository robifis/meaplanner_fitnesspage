			"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended while at rest. Use this calculator to find out your BMR and determine your caloric needs.Everybody requires a minimum number of calories to live. This minimum number is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR is the number of calories your organs need to function while you perform no activity whatsoever—like if you stayed in bed all day. If you're looking to lose weight, build muscle, or maintain your weight, this information can help you calculate the number of calories you need so you can make more informed decisions about your nutrition and exercise. Use this calculator to learn your BMR and the next steps to move toward your fitness goals!",

		description :
			'The thermic effect of food is the energy used to break down and digest the food you eat. Put simply, eating food burns calories. TEF is part of your total daily energy expenditure along with metabolism and physical activity. This is important because the more calories you burn, the easier it is to get in shape.Generally, TEF accounts for about 10% of the total calories you burn each day. To put it another way, digestion burns about 10 calories for every 100 calories you eat. Over the course of a day, that’s about the same number of calories as walking on a treadmill for 45 minutes. So each meal is like a little workout.',

		description :
			'Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis constitutes the number of calories expended during daily movement that is not categorized as structured exercise. NEAT includes activities such as walking the dog, moving from one room to another, or taking the stairs to your office. NEAT is highly variable from one person to another and can play a rather large or small role in your overall TDEE depending on how physically active your job or daily happenings are. For example, a waitress or construction worker will have a significantly greater NEAT than an office worker who sits at a desk for 8 hours of the day and spends 2 hours commuting to and from work ',

Similar to NEAT, thermic effect of exercise is highly variable from one person to another or even from one day to another for the same person, as the intensity of training, length of the workout, and training frequency all impact your weekly thermic effect of activity.',
